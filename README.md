# South Lyon's Pumpkinfest and its relationship to vegetarianism ðŸŽƒ:seedling:

This was a fun project, and my first attempt to scrape data from the web!

South Lyon is a city in Oakland County in Michigan (United States), with a population of 11,746. One of the most traditional events in the city is the Pumpkinfest, held in September every year. The festival includes the Great Pumpkin & Fun Veggies contest. Given the interest on veggies, one could think that South Lyon has a high percentage of vegetarian people. In order to investigate that, I scraped the web to find:
- the number of vegetarian restaurants in South Lyon

This was then compared to the number of vegetarian restaurants in Rochester, a city in the same county with a similar population (13,035).


The data was scraped from the yelp reviews of vegetarian restaurants in [South Lyon](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Vegetarian+Restaurants&find_loc=South+Lyon%2C+MI+48178%2C+United+States) and [Rochester](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Vegetarian+Restaurants&find_loc=Rochester%2C+MI%2C+United+States).


Skills I learned in this project:
- webdata scrapping 
- data wrangling
- data visualisation
